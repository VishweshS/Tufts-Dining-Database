Project done as part of the course DATA202, Spring 2023, Tufts University.

Abstract of the project: 
<br>
I designed a database system to manage the payroll process of the employees employed at Tufts Dining. The project included the creation of the database and also the development of a user guide to manage the database. The user guide contains queries to add data and scenarios for updating, deletion, and viewing the data in different forms. 

Guide to navigating the files:

* Database_Design.xlsx - An initial design created in Excel.
* Database_Creation.txt - This file has the queries to create the tables, add unique and check constraints, and add indexes.
* Database_Relationship_Diagram.png - This is a picture of the relationships built between the tables in the database.
* Database_User_Guide.txt - This file has the queries to insert data. In addition, it has queries for updates, deletions, and viewing of the data. These queries are for the essential scenarios that were identified to be used frequently.
